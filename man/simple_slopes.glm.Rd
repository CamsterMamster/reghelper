\title{Simple slopes of interaction.}
\usage{
\method{simple_slopes}{glm}(model, levels = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted linear model of type 'glm' with at least one
interaction term.}

\item{levels}{A list with element names corresponding to some or all of the
variables in the model. Each list element should be a vector with the names
of factor levels (for categorical variables) or numeric values (for
continuous variables) at which to test that variable. \strong{Note:} If you
do not include 'sstest' as one of these levels, the function will not test
the simple effects for that variable.}

\item{...}{Not currently implemented; used to ensure consistency with S3 generic.}
}
\value{
A data frame with a row for each simple effect. The first few columns
  identify the level at which each variable in your model was set for that
  test. A 'sstest' value in a particular column indicates that this was the
  variable being tested. After columns for each variable, the data frame has
  columns for the slope of the test variable, the standard error, t-value,
  p-value, and degrees of freedom for the model.
}
\description{
\code{simple_slopes.glm} calculates all the simple effects of an interaction
in a regression model.
}
\details{
If the model includes interactions at different levels (e.g., three two-way
interactions and one three-way interaction), the function will test the
simple effects of the highest-order interaction. If there are multiple
interactions in the highest order, it will test the first one in the model.
If you wish to test simple effects for a different interaction, simply switch
the order in the formula.

By default, this function will provide slopes at -1SD, the mean, and +1SD for
continuous variables, and at each level of categorical variables. This can be
overridden with the \code{levels} parameter.

If a categorical variable with more than two levels is being tested, you may
see multiple rows for that test. One row will be shown for each contrast for
that variable; the order is in the same order shown in \code{contrasts()}.

# mtcars data
model <- glm(vs ~ gear * wt, data=mtcars, family='binomial')
summary(model)  # marginal interaction
simple_slopes(model)
simple_slopes(model,
    levels=list(gear=c(2, 3, 4, 'sstest'), wt=c(2, 3, 'sstest')))  # test at specific levels
