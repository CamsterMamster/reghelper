reghelper
=========

The `reghelper` R package includes a set of functions used to automate
commonly used methods in regression analysis. This includes plotting
interactions, calculating simple slopes, calculating standardized
coefficients, etc.

Version 0.3.5 has been released. The most recent stable release is
available on CRAN, and can be installed like so:

``` r
install.packages("reghelper")
```

You can also install the stable release from Github:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jeff-hughes/reghelper")
```

If you would like to install the latest development version, you can do
so with the following code:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jeff-hughes/reghelper@develop")
```

### Installation Issues

Networked computers can sometimes result in installation issues, as the
`install_github` function sometimes has difficulty with networked
directories. If this happens to you, use the `.libPaths()` function to
find the path to your R libraries. That will likely give you a path
starting with two backslashes, but you will need to convert that to a
path starting with a drive letter (e.g., ‘C:’, ‘D:’). From there, use
the following code:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jeff-hughes/reghelper", args=c('--library="N:/path/to/libraries/"'))
```

Obviously, change the path to the path where your R libraries are
stored.

Current progress
----------------

So far, most functions that I had originally planned to include have
been implemented for `lm` models. These functions include:

-   `beta` Calculates standardized beta coefficients.
-   `build_model` Allows variables to be added to a series of regression
    models sequentially (similar to SPSS).
-   `ICC` Calculates the intra-class correlation for a multi-level
    model.
-   `cell_means` Calculates the estimated means for a fitted model.
-   `graph_model` Easily graph interactions at +/- 1 SD (uses ggplot2
    package).
-   `sig_regions` Calculate the Johnson-Neyman regions of significance
    for an interaction.
-   `simple_slopes` Easily calculate the simple effects of an
    interaction.

The table below shows the current types of models for which each
function has been implemented:

| Function       |  lm | glm | aov | lme | lmer |
